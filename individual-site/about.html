      <p style="max-width: 600px">I wanted to do something creative for this assignment, so I conceptualized each section of the site as its own "world", rather than a set of basic web pages. My goal was to make the site navigable, while still evoking a sense of curiosity and encouraging whoever visits the site to playfully explore. I originally planned to maintain certain unifying elements, but to truly design each page as its own separate ecosystem, with unique styling, unexpected layouts and highly graphical interfaces throughout. Unfortunately, I bit off more than I could chew in terms of my vision, the time we had, and how rusty I was writing the code. So, things are a bit messier than I'd like. That said, I'm going to continue working on it. I obviously still need to host my assignments here, and I think it will be a fun task to keep cleaning it up over the coming weeks and get creative with the remaining pages. </p>
