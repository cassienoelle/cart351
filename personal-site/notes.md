## Breakdown

### Landing Page
* Hello World(s)
  * auto type
  * 'World' pulsing colour change
  * 's' added on hover plus other focus effect (alien language?)
* Word 'Worlds' multiplies hundreds of time to cover the page and large halo around mouse position reveals what's behind
* Adapt from cart211 landing page
  * (note this in code so it's not self-plagiarizing)
* Enter home nav from here

### Home Nav
* Navigate to different "worlds" from here
